# Zimbra automated Let's Encrypt certificate generation, deployment and renewal
Files to automate the deploy of letsencrypt certificates to Zimbra

You will probably find these files useful when you want to move your self-signed Zimbra certificate to the [letsencrypt](https://letsencrypt.org/) valid one and automate the renewal of the certificate.

 - Set your variables by editing `letsencrypt-zimbra.conf` file
 - cd to the script folder and run `./zimbra-auto-letsencrypt.sh`, sit back and relax while your server gets a fresh certificate and deploys (zimbra services will be restarted)
 - run `./zimbra-auto-letsencrypt.sh --help` for help and for a copy-paste-friendly hint to automate renewals using crontab
 - Enjoy **open-source** and **encryption**!

Tested on Zimbra 8.7 and CentOS 7 host (will not work for Zimbra < 8.7 since zmcertmgr is running as zimbra user)
